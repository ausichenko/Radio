# Radio
Test android app from Dankolab 

The application was written using [MVP] pattern
## App Task
Needs to develop Internet radio stations client app.<br>
Enough to implement 2 screens:
1. List of stations
2. Player

You can find the list of stations here - https://dirble.com/developer/api<br>
If this option seems difficult, use another list
stations, the main thing that it was not sewn into the application.

The player must buffer the stream to avoid interrupts.
